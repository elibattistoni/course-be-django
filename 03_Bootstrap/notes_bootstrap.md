Bootstrap is a very commond framework used for Front-End development

What is a Framework?

A framework is different from a library or package.

Characteristics of a framework:
- inversion of control
- default behavior
- extensibility
- non-modifiable framework code

you're giving up control to the framework and the framework is going to have some sort of default behavior: the framework defines the rules to follow (usually you write some code that defines the rules then execute that code; this is not the case) (also Django defines the rules, it's a web framework for python)

A large part of Bootstrap is not memorization but really understanding how to reference the documentation for your own use cases.

**Default classes**
A key feature of Bootstrap are its default classes, and you can call these classes to quickly and easily build good looking features for your web applications.
