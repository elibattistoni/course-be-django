### Lists
HTML has 2 types of lists: ordered and unordered.

### div tag and span tag
we won't be able to utilize them until we learn about CSS.
div tag == division &rightarrow; it allows you to group together groups of elements into generic containers.
span tag &rightarrow; basically the same of a div, but the span is inline instead of grabbing an entire container.

### HTML attributes
They allow to add more information to HTML tags (e.g. adding a link to a webpage or referencing an image)
