# Front-End
The Front-End revolves around 3 core technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

jQuery and Bootstrap are also Front-End technologies, but they are built using the previous 3.

**HTML**
HyperText Markup language.
Every website has an HTML, it is the *structure* of a page.
You can view it by right-clicking and selecting "View page source".

**CSS**
Cascading Style Sheets.
It is the *styling* of a website.
Colores, fonts, borders, etc.
CSS is not mandatory, but almost all sites have it in order to make it look good.

**Javascript**
allows you to add interactivity to the website, including programming logic
if the site doesn't do anything, it only displays information, the site is "static"

# Back-End
The Back-End of a site has three components:
- the Language (the language you choose for the BE)
- the Framework (the framwork you choose for that language)
- the Database (the db you want to connect to)

here:
- Python as the language
- Django as the framework
- SQLite as the database
