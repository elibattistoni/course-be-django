# Javascript

This section will begin to build our understanding of adding interactive functionality to our websites.

Javascript support is built directly into modern web browsers.
We can run Javascript directly into the browser console, or as a full .js script connected to an HTML file.
Javascript is a full programming language, i.e. unlike HTML or CSS it supports things such as arrays, loops, and general logic.

We will see how to use Javascript to directly change the HTML or CSS shown on a page.
